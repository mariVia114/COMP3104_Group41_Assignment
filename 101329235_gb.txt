One of the Fathers of Confederation, George Brown (1818–1880) was a Scottish-born Canadian politician 
and publisher of newspapers. Brown was a key player in the creation of Canada and a fervent 
supporter of free public education.

Bill Davis, the Ontario Minister of Education at the time, proposed that the new college of applied arts and 
technology be called George Brown College in 1967—the year of Canada's centennial—noting that it would be fitting for 
"the city to which George Brown added such lustre as a reformer, journalist, and statesman to honour him in this way."
