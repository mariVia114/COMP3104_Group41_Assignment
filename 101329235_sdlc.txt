tasks like data administration and library upgrades for new product releases are combined. The foundations of 
application development and delivery are crucial for DevOps engineers to comprehend.

inside an organisation. By physically combining the tasks and processes of development and operations, 
the usage of DevOps technologies and automation of the software delivery process creates a collaborative environment.
